# BashBase
A really stupid bash "database" implementation. *Just a way to manipulate lists of key=value pairs*, not a serious database. I did it because I was sick of rewriting some 'state' management for my interactive scripts, and wanted a unified way for my furture scripts.

**Take a look at [example.bash](example.bash) to know what it can do.**


**Dependencies**: `bash`, `gawk` and `standard GNU utils`
